         <h2>What is Blockchain Technology?</h2>
         </div>
         <div class="text">
         <p>
            Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.’<BR>

            Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information the digital ledger contains is highly secure.<BR>

         <h3>How Does Blockchain Technology Work?</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
         <p>
             In recent years, you may have noticed many businesses around the world integrating Blockchain technology. But how exactly does Blockchain technology work? Is this a significant change or a simple addition? The advancements of Blockchain are still young and have the potential to be revolutionary in the future; so, let’s begin demystifying this technology.<BR>

Blockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:
        <ul>
            <li>Cryptographic keys</li>
            <li>A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger</li>
            <li>A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network   </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Cryptography keys consist of two keys – Private key and Public key. These keys help in performing successful transactions between two parties. Each individual has these two keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency, this identity is referred to as ‘digital signature’ and is used for authorizing and controlling transactions.<BR>

The digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.

         <h3>Hash Encryptions</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
         <p>
             Blockchain technology uses hash encryption to secure the data, relying mainly on the SHA256 algorithm to secure the information. The address of the sender (public key), the receiver’s address, the transaction, and his/her private key details are transmitted via the SHA256 algorithm. The encrypted information, called hash encryption, is transmitted across the world and added to the Blockchain after verification. The SHA256 algorithm makes it almost impossible to hack the hash encryption, which in turn simplifies the sender and receiver’s authentication.

              <h3>Proof of Work</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
             <p>
               In a Blockchain, each block consists of 4 main headers.
               <ul>
            
               
<li>Previous Hash: This hash address locates the previous block.</li>
<li>Transaction Details: Details of all the transactions that need to occur.</li>
<li>Nonce: An arbitrary number given in cryptography to differentiate the block’s hash address.</li>
<li>Hash Address of the Block: All of the above (i.e., preceding hash, transaction details, and nonce) are transmitted through a hashing algorithm. This gives an output containing a 256-bit, 64 character length value, which is called the unique ‘hash address.’ Consequently, it is referred to as the hash of the block.</li>
<li>Numerous people around the world try to figure out the right hash value to meet a pre-determined condition using computational algorithms. The transaction completes when the predetermined condition is met. To put it more plainly, Blockchain miners attempt to solve a mathematical puzzle, which is referred to as a proof of work problem. Whoever solves it first gets a reward.</li>

              <h4>What Are the Implications of Blockchain Technology?</h4>
            </div>

<div class="text">
         <p>
            <ul>

            <li> Bitcoin, Blockchain’s prime application and the whole reason the technology was developed in the first place, has helped many people through financial services such as digital wallets. It has provided microloans and allowed micropayments to people in less than ideal economic circumstances, thereby introducing new life in the world economy.</li>
<li>The next major impact is in the concept of  TRUST, especially within the sphere of international transactions. Previously, lawyers were hired to bridge the trust gap between two different parties, but it consumed extra time and money. But the introduction of Cryptocurrency has radically changed the trust equation. Many organizations are located in areas where resources are scarce, and corruption is widespread. In such cases, Blockchain renders a significant advantage to these affected people and organizations, allowing them to escape the tricks of unreliable third-party intermediaries.</li>
<li>In the area of politics, Blockchain is being looked at by an organization called Follow My Vote, which is trying to combat election fraud at the ballot box.</li>
<li>The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has unleashed a plethora of smart machines that transfer data over the Internet without any human interaction needed. Likewise, technology is even used for public services such as rubbish collection, transportation, and traffic management. So, in the world of IoT, you can make Smart Contracts and allow smart objects to perform the listed tasks, which in turn negates the need for human involvement.  </li>
<li>Blockchain technology can create a decentralized peer-to-peer network for organizations or apps like Airbnb and Uber. It allows people to pay for things like toll fees, parking, etc.</li>
<li>Blockchain technology can be used as a secure platform for the healthcare industry for the purposes of storing sensitive patient data. Health-related organizations can create a centralized database with the technology and share the information with only the appropriately authorized people.</li>
